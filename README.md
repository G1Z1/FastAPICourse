# FastAPI Course

This is a repository of all of the code I've written while following freeCodeCamp's [Python API Development - Comprehensive Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/0sOvCWFmrtA) course by Sanjeev Thiyagarajan. Easily one of the best course I've ever followed.

This is a Python FastAPI project that covers just about everything you'd need in thorough detail - routing, SQL, ORMs, CORS, JWT and Oauth2 - and even goes into setting up a Linux Server in the cloud, Docker and Docker Compose, GitHub Actions and secrets, Pytest and more.

I will continue working on this repo by setting up a self-hosted CI/CD pipeline for my home Debian server, possibly integrating Ansible.
